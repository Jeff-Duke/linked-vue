#Linked-Vue

A place to track your favorite links.  This project was built in `Vue.js` and is one of many projects from the [Turing School](https://turing.io).  Original project spec is [here.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

There are seperate branches for each phase of the spec:
- [Phase1](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/linked-vue/tree/phase-1)
- [Phase2](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/linked-vue/tree/phase-2)
- [Phase3](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/linked-vue/tree/phase-3)
- [Phase4](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/linked-vue/tree/phase-4)
- [Final](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/linked-vue/tree/final)
The **Final** branch includes the Phase-4 code but with additional refactors to make the code more readable and to help with deployment.
